The purpose of this github web page is to start a project to help users after they cloned what they wanted to explore
Also this project is to help users to make use of what others did but noobes don't know what to do with their efforts.
This is because creators don't help their followers to replicate what they have accomplished, which is ashame.  Their work could have carried on only if they help their follower to replcicate what they did and improve on their efforts.
I don't believe closing the door on people that follows you.  These people are loyalist why do you abandon them, so your ego won't be broken, because you're afraid your followers can surpassed you.
To be a real tailblazer is to let your followers to be better than you.  Your purpose is to open the trails.  Your followers are the one to take it to the next level.  You as a trailblazer open the way for your loyal followers to shine their protentials.
In turns, their followers will take it further to complete the mission.  I hate peeps that close the door behind them.  They are dening more brillant peeps behind them to take their idea to fruition.
I for one cheerish the relay where I could take the team to best themselves and reach the maximum they have to offer to the world.  Don't hold back, go all the way.  If you can't do it youself, help the next leg to take the next step and so on to reach the final goal.
Being part of a true accomplishment is better than stopping at the begining.
